# Toggle HDR Extension

This is an extension for Microsoft PowerToys' Command Palette tool (CmdPal). It enables you to toggle Windows HDR for one display at a time, unlike the global Win + Alt + B shortcut which toggles it for _all_ monitors. Handy if you like a shortcut to selectively enable HDR for some games but not others, and don't want to have it enabled on your other (non-primary) monitors.

## How To Use

After installing the extension, opening CmdPal, and starting to type "toggle" you will see one of two things:

1. A list of displays that have HDR capability, where selecting one will toggle Windows HDR for that display.
2. A message indicating no displays have HDR capability: `Toggle HDR - No displays support HDR`.

## Toggle HDR Extension

This is an extension for Microsoft PowerToys' Command Palette tool. It enables you to toggle Windows HDR for one display at a time, unlike the global Win + Alt + B shortcut which toggles it for _all_ monitors. Handy if you like a shortcut to selectively enable HDR for some games but not others, and don't want to have it enabled on your other (non-primary) monitors.
